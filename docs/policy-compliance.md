## Introduction

This guide covers the compliance requirements for the Royal Locksmith website (Hackensack, NJ) regarding Google and Microsoft's policies. Adhering to these policies is essential for maintaining advertising accounts, business listings, and organic search visibility for Royal Locksmith. Non-compliance can result in ads being disapproved, business listings being suspended, or websites being penalized in search results.

### Why Compliance Matters for Locksmiths

The locksmith industry (including Royal Locksmith) is considered a restricted business category by both Google and Microsoft due to:

- **Trust and Safety Concerns**: Locksmiths have access to homes and businesses
- **History of Scams**: The industry has experienced issues with fraudulent operators
- **Emergency Service Nature**: Customers are often in vulnerable situations
- **Price Transparency Issues**: Concerns about bait-and-switch pricing tactics

Maintaining strict compliance helps Royal Locksmith differentiate itself from scammers and build trust with both customers and advertising platforms.
